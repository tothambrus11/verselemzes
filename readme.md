# Poet rhythm  analyzer
This weekend project is about analysing the rhythm of Hungarian poets. There are several rules for doing this but the Hungarian language has sounds, which has two or three letters in it (ny, ty, dz, dzs...), so it was a bit more difficult to write an algorithm than I expected.

The program is available at https://johetajava.hu/verselemzes, or can be downloaded from the sources and opened by a browser.

Example poets:
```
Tóth Gyula bádogos és
vízvezeték-szerelő.
```

```
Áfás számla igényét
kérjük előre jelezze!
```
